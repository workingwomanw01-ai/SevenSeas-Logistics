## Technical Implementation Notes

### Metadata Structure
Due to Next.js 13+ App Router constraints, metadata implementation varies by component type:

#### Server Components (can export metadata directly):
- **Blogs** (`/app/blogs/page.js`) - Server component with direct metadata export
- **Root Layout** (`/app/layout.js`) - Contains default/home page metadata

#### Client Components (require layout.js files):
For client components that use `"use client"` directive, metadata is moved to separate `layout.js` files:
- **Quote** (`/app/quote/layout.js`)
- **Tracking** (`/app/tracking/layout.js`) 
- **Contact** (`/app/contact/layout.js`)
- **Services** (`/app/services/layout.js`)
- **About** (`/app/about/layout.js`)
- **Careers** (`/app/careers/layout.js`)
- **Resources** (`/app/resources/layout.js`)
- **International Transport** (`/app/services/international-transport/layout.js`)
- **Local Truck Transport** (`/app/services/local-truck-transport/layout.js`)
- **Fast Personal Delivery** (`/app/services/fast-personal-delivery/layout.js`)

Each layout file follows this structure:
```javascript
// Metadata for the [page name]
export const metadata = {
  title: "Page Title - Certified Freight Logistics",
  description: "Compelling page description...",
  keywords: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3",
  openGraph: {
    title: "Page Title",
    description: "Social media description",
    url: "/page-url",
    type: "website",
    images: [{ url: "/images/feature-image.jpg", width: 1200, height: 630 }],
  },
  twitter: {
    card: "summary_large_image",
    title: "Page Title",
    description: "Twitter description",
    images: ["/images/feature-image.jpg"],
  },
}

export default function PageLayout({ children }) {
  return children
}
```
